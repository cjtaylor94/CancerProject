As I have an interest in healthcare technology and statistics, I wanted to create a visualization of how different types of cancer impact different communities in the United States. These communities can have varied impacts of cancer, that could be driven by various external factors that can be explored visually. Additionally, cancers have different survival rates and can hit a community and individuals harder, visualizing this difference can help bring better understanding to cancer’s impact on a community. This webpage visualizes these communities’ overall cancer profile looking at at different demographics, cancer sites, survival rates, and geography determine how cancer impacts communities around the country.

The Data for these visualizations came from three major sources the CDC, National Cancer Institute, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Number of cancer cases by msa, and varying demographics in 2016 came from the CDC. While 5 year conditional survival rates calculated from 2000-2016 were pulled from SEER portal of the National Cancer Institute, and lastly we used Metropolitan area population estimates in 2016 from the the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
