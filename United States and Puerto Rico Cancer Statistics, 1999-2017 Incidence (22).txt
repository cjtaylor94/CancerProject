Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' is displayed for data values when they must not be provided in order to protect personal privacy. Data is"
"suppressed if fewer than 16 cases are reported in any one line of the results table. Data for the ""Asian / Pacific Islander"""
"and ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" race categories are suppressed at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level for"
"populations less than 50,000 persons. Data are suppressed at the state and Metropolitan Statistical Area level for certain race"
"and ethnicity groups: 1) ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" race data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for Delaware,"
"Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, and New York; 2) ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" race data are suppressed at the state and"
"MSA level for Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, and Kentucky; 3) ""Hispanic"" ethnicity data are supressed at the state and MSA level"
"for Delaware, and Kentucky. 4) All combinations of race by ethnicity are supressed at the state and MSA level for Delaware,"
"Kansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. More information:"

"2. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for all data values when sex-specific cancers are combined with the wrong sex. More"
"information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2017.html#Genital Cancers List."
"3. 'Missing' is displayed for a combination of states/territories/MSAs and years that did not meet the United States Cancer"
"Statistics (USCS) publication standard or did not allow permission for their data to be used."
"4. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
